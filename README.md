Source code for a Movie Trailer Website.

## Directions

- Download the movie_trailer_website.zip folder and unzip.
- In Python shell, open and run **favorites.py** in the newly unzipped folder.  The program will create two new .pyc files and an .html file.
- Open and view .html file with your web browser.

**NOTE:** To view on a machine without Python installed, you can alternatively download the larger movie_trailer_website_alt.zip folder, which contains all necessary resources after running the **favorites.py** program.
